Brightness Menulet
==================

Allows you to control monitor brigthness via menu in status bar.

This tool works on OSX 10.8+. In 10.8+, I2C tools are not able to detect monitor buses for communication.
The main API calls for DDC communication is deprecated so this project could be obselete if Apple 
completely removes CGDisplayIOServicePort. If you have tested your monitor(s) with this tool, please
let me know wether it worked or not so I can add monitor models here.
